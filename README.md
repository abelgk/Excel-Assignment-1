    Showcase the relationship between four key variables:
        Average Fare ($) Per City
        Total Number of Rides Per City
        Total Number of Drivers Per City
        City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

    Three pie charts:

        % of Total Fares by City Type
        % of Total Rides by City Type
        % of Total Drivers by City Type
Below are some of the notable trends:
-	We can observe that Urban city types charge the highest fares in comparison to Rural and Suburban city types
-	We can also observe that the highest number of rides are hired in Urban city types (68% of the total rides from our sample data)
-	the other observation we can gather from the data is that Urban city drivers also account for the highest share in comparison to Rural and Suburban city types.
